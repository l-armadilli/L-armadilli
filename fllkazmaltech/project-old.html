                        <p><br><strong>KAZ</strong>:&nbsp; Over the past few months, our team has been doing research on problems with space travel, and solutions to these problems. Further, we have settled on the problem, that is harmful radiation and the
                            inherent problems that come with going into the vast barren vacuum of space.<strong>ANNIKA</strong>: Since Earth has something called a magnetosphere which protects us from radiation, we are safe. In space, we do not have a
                            magnetosphere. <strong>MILES</strong>: We will need a way to protect ourselves from harmful radiation if we want to stay safe and healthy.<strong>KAZ</strong>: On the International Space Station (ISS) there is a “room” inside
                            of which astronauts are protected from harmful radiation, so if said astronauts detect a solar flare they will enter this room and be safe. <strong>MILES</strong>: The reason this is only one room is that the radiation protecting
                            substance is very heavy<strong>MIA</strong>: NASA’s current proposed solution to this weight problem is called hydrogenated boron nitride nanotubes. This would be a terrific solution except for the fact that it costs ~$1,000
                            per gram. <strong>JACK</strong>: Not to mention, NASA has to be very careful when they spend money because they only get funded about a 10 billion dollars a year. Bringing things to space is expensive, for example, the Hubble
                            space telescope cost NASA around $15 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ANNIKA</strong>: Which brings us to our proposed solution. Lining the outside of the spacecraft with water. <strong>MILES</strong>: Water, which humans already
                            need to live, can block solar flares and other types of harmful radiation. <strong>JACK</strong>: This is perfect because it adds no extra weight nor does it cost extra money. Also, spacecraft already need to take water to
                            space because it is a human necessity.<strong>MILES</strong>: Water, which is a human necessity, is cost effective because it is necessary and has multiple purposes as it can block harmful radiation and keep the astronauts
                            alive.<strong>JACK</strong>: We spoke to Radiation oncologist Dr. Faisal Siddiqui. He told us that radiation is harmful to the body and damages tissue and DNA. This can cause effects seen years later or dangerous immediate
                            effects. <strong>MIA</strong>: He also said that in high doses, it can cause enough damage to be fatal. <strong>ANNIKA</strong>: He says that someone who has had radiation-induced cancer has a higher risk of getting another
                            type of cancer later in life.<strong>MILES</strong>: We also spoke to Mr. Julian Powell who currently works at Blue origin as an aerospace engineer. MIA: We were wondering if micrometeorites would bombard the spacecraft and
                            make it a leaking, rolling body in the unforgiving vacuum of space. <strong>JACK</strong>: On the contrary, he told us that the chances of a given spacecraft being hit by a meteorite or a micrometeorite are extremely low. And
                            even if it does hit the spacecraft the chances of it puncturing the spacecraft are equally low.&nbsp;<br><strong>KAZ</strong>: Another compelling point is water recycling. NASA uses something called multi-filtration beds. Our
                            solution is to line the outside of the spacecraft with said multi-filtration beds. <strong>MIA</strong>: This will keep a constant flow of water flowing through the outside of the spacecraft. Since NASA already needs to recycle
                            their water and bring water up to the spacecraft this solution will cost no extra money nor does it add any weight.<strong>ANNIKA</strong>: You may ask, or at least think to yourself, how have we brought this to the community.
                            And this is a legitimate question because feedback and review are valuable to any project or presentation. So before we finish we would like to tell you what we did to share this idea with the community and also the experts
                            we spoke to. <strong>KAZ</strong>: We created an optional assembly at our school the nature of which was you come, you give feedback, and you get snacks. We got some amazing feedback on our presentation, on our content and
                            even our poise and confidence. We also gave this very script to multiple of our teachers. We spoke to two experts in this field (Radiation oncologist Dr. Faisal Siddiqui MD PHD and aerospace engineer Julian Powell).<strong>MIA</strong>:
                            In conclusion, what makes our solution of lining the outside of the spacecraft optimal is its cost, and that it adds no extra weight. <strong>JACK</strong>: It seems so obvious. Water. A human necessity that can absorb radiation.
                            It is truly a beautiful coincidence. <strong>ANNIKA</strong>: We already need to take water up to wherever we are going because we need it to live. We also already need to filter and recycle our water. <strong>KAZ</strong>:
                            That paired with the need to protect oneself from the inherent dangers of space makes our solution of lining the outside of the spacecraft with the water filtration system optimal. What makes our solution truly perfect is that
                            it is not a new solution. It combines other solutions to problems that we already need to solve (water recycling and bringing water up to space) to solve a problem we already need to solve. Thank you very much.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
